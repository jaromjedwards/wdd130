<h1>
        DJ LANTN : Jarom Edwards
</h1>

<p> My website proposal is to make a DJ website for my small business. I will make a homepage which will include links to other pages, pictures, explain the sight, and show reviews. My other two pages will be where you can book the DJ, and where you can find vendors like photographers I have worked with</p>
